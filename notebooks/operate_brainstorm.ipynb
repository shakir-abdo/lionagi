       "\n",
       "Refactoring a FastAPI application to incorporate asynchronous SQLAlchemy CRUD operations using an SQLite database involves a structured approach. Here's how you can achieve this:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Setup Dependencies**:\n",
       "   - Ensure you have `fastapi`, `sqlalchemy`, `aiosqlite`, and `databases` installed in your environment. Use `pip` to install these dependencies if you haven't done so yet.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   ```bash\n",
       "   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy aiosqlite databases asyncpg\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Database Configuration**:\n",
       "   - Configure the asynchronous database URL using `databases`.\n",
       "\n",
       "   ```python\n",
       "   from databases import Database\n",
       "\n",
       "   DATABASE_URL = \"sqlite+aiosqlite:///./test.db\"\n",
       "   database = Database(DATABASE_URL)\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Define Models with SQLAlchemy**:\n",
       "   - Use SQLAlchemy to define the book model. Make sure to configure it for async operations.\n",
       "\n",
       "   ```python\n",
       "   from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String\n",
       "   from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n",
       "   from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n",
       "\n",
       "   engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, echo=True, future=True)\n",
       "   SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)\n",
       "   Base = declarative_base()\n",
       "\n",
       "   class Book(Base):\n",
       "       __tablename__ = 'books'\n",
       "\n",
       "       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n",
       "       title = Column(String, index=True)\n",
       "       author = Column(String, index=True)\n",
       "       description = Column(String)\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Create Async Session**:\n",
       "   - Modify the session creation to use asynchronous capabilities with SQLAlchemy 1.4 or above.\n",
       "\n",
       "   ```python\n",
       "   from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession, create_async_engine\n",
       "   from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n",
       "\n",

       "   AsyncSessionLocal = sessionmaker(bind=async_engine, class_=AsyncSession, expire_on_commit=False)\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Implement CRUD Operations**:\n",
       "   - Use async functions for CRUD operations. Wrap database operations with `database.connect` to ensure the database is connected asynchronously.\n",
       "\n",
       "   ```python\n",
       "   async def get_book_by_id(book_id: int):\n",
       "       async with AsyncSessionLocal() as session:\n",
       "           result = await session.execute(select(Book).where(Book.id == book_id))\n",

       "           return book\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **FastAPI Application Setup**:\n",
       "   - Initialize FastAPI and include startup/shutdown events to handle database connections.\n",
       "\n",
       "   ```python\n",
       "   from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends\n",

       "   @app.on_event(\"shutdown\")\n",
       "   async def shutdown():\n",
       "       await database.disconnect()\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Error Handling Middleware**:\n",
       "   - Implement middleware to catch and transform exceptions into consistent response formats.\n",
       "\n",
       "   ```python\n",
       "   from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse\n",
       "\n",
       "   @app.middleware(\"http\")\n",
       "   async def add_custom_error_handling(request, call_next):\n",
       "       try:\n",
       "           return await call_next(request)\n",
       "       except Exception as e:\n",
       "           return JSONResponse(status_code=500, content={\"message\": \"An error occurred\"})\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **API Endpoint Examples**:\n",
       "   - Define endpoints for CRUD operations showcasing async handlers.\n",
       "\n",
       "   ```python\n",
       "   @app.get(\"/books/{book_id}\", response_model=Book)\n",
       "   async def read_book(book_id: int):\n",
       "       book = await get_book_by_id(book_id)\n",
       "       if book is None:\n",
       "           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=\"Book not found\")\n",
       "       return book\n",
       "\n",
       "   @app.post(\"/books/\", response_model=Book)\n",
       "   async def add_book(book: Book):\n",
       "       return await create_book(book)\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "The above steps provide a comprehensive approach to refactoring a FastAPI app into one that leverages asynchronous database operations using SQLAlchemy and `aiosqlite`, complete with error handling middleware for consistent application behavior.

       "To implement JWT authentication in a FastAPI library project, follow these steps, focusing on secure token creation, detailed documentation, and unit testing:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Setup FastAPI and JWT Utilities:**\n",
       "   - Install necessary packages: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-jose`, `passlib`, and `pytest`.\n",
       "   - Import required modules:\n",
       "     ```python\n",
       "     from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException\n",
       "     from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm\n",
       "     from jose import JWTError, jwt\n",
       "     from passlib.context import CryptContext\n",
       "     from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n",
       "     from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
       "     ```\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Define Configuration and Models:**\n",
       "   - Set JWT secret key and algorithm:\n",
       "     ```python\n",
       "     SECRET_KEY = \"your_secret_key\"\n",
       "     ALGORITHM = \"HS256\"\n",
       "     ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30\n",
       "     ```\n",
       "   - Create Pydantic models:\n",
       "     ```python\n",
       "     class User(BaseModel):\n",
       "         username: str\n",
       "\n",
       "     class UserInDB(User):\n",
       "         hashed_password: str\n",
       "\n",
       "     class Token(BaseModel):\n",
       "         access_token: str\n",
       "         token_type: str\n",
       "     ```\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Implement Password Hashing:**\n",
       "   - Use PassLib for secure password hashing:\n",
       "     ```python\n",
       "     pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=[\"bcrypt\"], deprecated=\"auto\")\n",
       "\n",
       "     def verify_password(plain_password, hashed_password):\n",
       "         return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)\n",
       "\n",
       "     def get_password_hash(password):\n",
       "         return pwd_context.hash(password)\n",
       "     ```\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Create JWT Utility Functions:**\n",
       "   - Implement token creation and verification:\n",
       "     ```python\n",
       "     def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: timedelta = None):\n",
       "         to_encode = data.copy()\n",
       "         if expires_delta:\n",
       "             expire = datetime.utcnow() + expires_delta\n",
       "         else:\n",
       "             expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=15)\n",
       "         to_encode.update({\"exp\": expire})\n",
       "         encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)\n",
       "         return encoded_jwt\n",
       "\n",
       "     def decode_token(token: str):\n",
       "         try:\n",
       "             payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])\n",
       "             return payload[\"sub\"]\n",
       "         except JWTError:\n",
       "             raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Could not validate credentials\")\n",
       "     ```\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Secure Endpoints Using Dependency Injection:**\n",
       "   - Create OAuth2PasswordBearer instance:\n",
       "     ```python\n",
       "     oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl=\"token\")\n",
       "     ```\n",
       "\n",
       "   - Protect endpoints:\n",
       "     ```python\n",
       "     async def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):\n",
       "         username = decode_token(token)\n",
       "         if username is None:\n",
       "             raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Invalid credentials\")\n",
       "         return username\n",
       "\n",
       "     @app.get(\"/books/\")\n",
       "     async def read_books(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):\n",
       "         return [{\"book_id\": \"1\", \"title\": \"1984\"}]\n",
       "     ```\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Implement User Registration and Login:**\n",
       "   - Register new users and login to get tokens:\n",
       "     ```python\n",
       "     fake_users_db = {\"johndoe\": UserInDB(username=\"johndoe\", hashed_password=get_password_hash(\"secret\"))}\n",
       "\n",
       "     @app.post(\"/token\", response_model=Token)\n",
       "     async def login_for_access_token(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):\n",
       "         user = fake_users_db.get(form_data.username)\n",
       "         if not user or not verify_password(form_data.password, user.hashed_password):\n",
       "             raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Incorrect username or password\")\n",
       "         access_token_expires = timedelta(minutes=ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES)\n",
       "         access_token = create_access_token(data={\"sub\": user.username}, expires_delta=access_token_expires)\n",
       "         return {\"access_token\": access_token, \"token_type\": \"bearer\"}\n",
       "     ```\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Document Endpoints and Write Unit Tests:**\n",
       "   - Use FastAPI's automatic documentation to ensure endpoints are well-documented.\n",
       "   - Write unit tests for token generation and authorization:\n",
       "     ```python\n",
       "     def test_token_creation():\n",
       "         response = client.post(\n",
       "             \"/token\",\n",
       "             data={\"username\": \"johndoe\", \"password\": \"secret\"},\n",
       "         )\n",
       "         assert response.status_code == 200\n",
       "         \n",
       "     def test_books_endpoint_requires_authentication():\n",
       "         response = client.get(\"/books/\")\n",
       "         assert response.status_code == 401\n",
       "     ```\n",
       "\n",
       "This setup provides a robust and secure foundation for a FastAPI library application, ensuring that only authenticated users can access library operations through JWT-based authentication."
